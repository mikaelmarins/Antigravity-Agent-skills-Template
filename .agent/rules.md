# Agent Rules & Laws

## Security
1.  **NEVER** commit API keys, passwords, or secrets to Git.
2.  **ALWAYS** use `.env` files for configuration variables.

## Code Quality
1.  **Tests Required**: No feature is complete without a verification test (manual or automated).
2.  **Linting**: Follow the existing project's style guide. If none exists, create `knowledge/coding_style.md` to define one.
3.  **Review**: Read `AI_MEMORY.md` before starting major tasks to ensure alignment with the roadmap.

## Workflow
1.  **Atomic Commits**: Keep changes focused on one task at a time.
2.  **Update Documentation**: If you change how something works, update the docs immediately.
