# Project Knowledge Base

This folder contains **static** reference documentation given to the agent.

## Examples of what goes here:
- `coding_style.md`: Using functional vs OO, naming conventions.
- `api_specs.md`: External API documentation.
- `design_system.md`: CSS variables and component tokens.

*Unlike `AI_MEMORY.md`, which is fluid and updated often, files here change rarely and act as "Textbooks".*
